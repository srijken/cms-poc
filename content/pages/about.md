# About This Project

This project demonstrates a **headless CMS** implementation using modern web technologies while maintaining strict security and performance standards.

## Technical Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework with static generation
- **TinaCMS**: Local content management system
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting

## Security Features

The site implements a **strict Content Security Policy** that:

- Prevents execution of unauthorized scripts
- Blocks inline styles and scripts in production
- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- Enhances overall security posture

## Performance Optimizations

- Static HTML generation
- Minimal JavaScript bundle
- Optimized asset loading
- Efficient content delivery
